Recipe for Tortilla pizza:
Prep-time: 10 mins

----Ingredients----
4 tbsp passata
1 garlic clove, crushed
½ tbsp olive oil
½ tsp dried herbs (mixed herbs, basil or oregano work well)
2 plain tortillas
50g grated mozzarella
6-8 slices pepperoni
6-8 pickled jalapeño slices

----Method----
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.
Mix the passata, garlic, olive oil, herbs
and season well. Put the tortillas onto
one large baking sheet, or two smaller
ones. Spread over the tomato sauce
leaving a 1cm border around the edges.
Scatter with the mozzarella, add the
pepperoni and jalapeños. Bake for 6-8
minutes until the edges of the tortillas
are crisp and golden, and the cheese has
melted and is bubbling.
